/**
 * A [DispatchAction] emitted this tick, tagged with the [CommandId] issued when it was posted
 * to the actuator queue, so it can be tracked in [WorkingMemory.pendingRequests] until the
 * matching [cz.vutbr.fit.interlockSim.dispatcher.observation.AppliedOutcome] arrives or the
 * entry expires by TTL (SP2c.7, Issue #830).
 *
 * ## Purpose
 *
 * The dispatcher control loop emits `DispatchAction` values toward the actuator. Between emission
 * and confirmation there is an asynchronous gap: the action is translated into a
 * [cz.vutbr.fit.interlockSim.sim.DispatchDecision], posted to
 * [cz.vutbr.fit.interlockSim.dispatcher.ActuatorCommandQueue], drained on the sim thread, and only
 * then does an `AppliedOutcome` arrive in the next (or a later) tick's
 * [cz.vutbr.fit.interlockSim.dispatcher.observation.DispatcherObservation]. [AttributedAction] is
 * the **before** half; [commandId] is the link that lets [WorkingMemory.update] match the
 * **after** half — [cz.vutbr.fit.interlockSim.dispatcher.observation.AppliedOutcome.id] always
 * carries the same [CommandId] that
 * [cz.vutbr.fit.interlockSim.dispatcher.CommandCorrelationMap.register] issued at post time
 * (SP2c.17, Issue #840).
 *
 * ## Why [tick] is a separate field
 *
 * Unlike the superseded `CorrelationId` value class this type replaces, [CommandId] is an opaque
 * monotonic counter with no embedded tick — it is assigned by
 * [cz.vutbr.fit.interlockSim.dispatcher.CommandCorrelationMap] and never surfaced back to the
 * poster except via the eventual [cz.vutbr.fit.interlockSim.dispatcher.observation.AppliedOutcome].
 * [WorkingMemory]'s TTL bookkeeping needs to know the tick a pending entry was *added* on
 * (independent of whether/when an outcome ever arrives), so [tick] is carried alongside
 * [commandId] explicitly rather than derived from it.
 *
 * ## [DispatchAction.NoOp]
 *
 * A `no_op` action produces no actuator side-effect and therefore never generates an
 * `AppliedOutcome`. [WorkingMemory.update] skips `no_op` entries when adding to
 * [WorkingMemory.pendingRequests] to avoid spurious pending-request leaks.
 *
 * @property commandId Correlation key for this action instance, assigned at actuator-queue
 *   post time.
 * @property tick Dispatcher tick this action was recorded on (used for TTL expiry).
 * @property action The action that was emitted to the actuator.
 *
 * @since Issue #830 (SP2c.7 — Goal 10 ring buffer)
